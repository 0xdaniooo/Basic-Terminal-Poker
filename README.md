## About
Poker had been something that was heavily on my mind after playing it with friends and family. The rules and way of playing was quite complex for me at first so I decided to speed up my learning by building this program and learning all the intricacies by hand. The base of the game is built off of a YouTube series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au31WqDtXYI) which I took and expanded to allow for a dynamic experience. 

## Features
- Ability to add players
- Specify the amount you're playing for
- Calling, Raising, Folding and going All In
- Automatically calculates your hand combination
- !!Winning!!

## Things I've learnt
- Using Visual Studio (debugging, refactoring code and general usage)
- Brushing up on my C# skills
- Splitting tasks up into smaller subtasks to make them more manageable
- How the game of Poker is built from the ground up

# Usage
```
- Run the Poker-test.exe executable binary found in the Poker folder:
  .\Poker-test.exe (or double click it in the file explorer)
```
