# Basic-Terminal-Poker
As the name suggests, this is a basic Poker game you can play in your terminal. This is a very barebones design as it was intended for the purposes of teaching myself how Poker works and building a base for a future GUI version of the app.

# Inspiration
The base of the game is built off of this YouTube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au31WqDtXYI

## Features
- Ability to add players
- Specify the amount you're playing for
- Calling, Raising, Folding and going All In
- Automatically calculates your hand combination
- !!Winning!!

## Things I've learnt
- Using Visual Studio (debugging, refactoring code and general usage)
- Brushing up on my C# skills
- Splitting tasks up into smaller subtasks to make them more manageable
- How the game of Poker is built from the ground up
